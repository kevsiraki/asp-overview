<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! You’re here, which means you’re interested in knowing what data we collect from you. (Spoiler alert: it’s practically none!) But let’s break it down anyway.</p>

<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<p>Absolutely nothing. Yep, you read that right! We’re just a simple documentation site here to provide you with helpful information, and we don’t need any personal data to do that.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>No cookies here. We think cookies are delicious, but only the edible kind! 🍪 We don’t use tracking cookies, analytics cookies, or any other kind of cookies on this site.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>There are no third-party services spying on you through our site. We don’t embed trackers, ads, or analytics. It’s just us here.</p>

<h2>Your Data</h2>
<p>Since we don’t collect any personal information, there’s nothing to store, sell, or share. Your data stays with you, where it belongs!</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>If we ever change our no-data-collection policy (unlikely!), we’ll be sure to update this page and keep you in the loop. But for now, rest assured that you’re browsing anonymously.</p>
